=> These examples also point out an important concept about commands. Most commands operate like this:

"command -options arguments"

where command is the name of the command, -options is one or more adjustments to the command's behavior, and arguments is one or more "things" upon which the command operates.

In the case of ls, we see that ls is the name of the command, and that it can have one or more options, such as -a and -l, and it can operate on one or more files or directories

#!/bin/bash   -> To tell the computer that this is a script and it would be executed with bash. In this case, anything that follows the line are being executed

chmod u+x "fileName" -> This is use to convert the to an "exe" file that can be run

./fileName -> This is used to run the file on the terminal in order to ensure it works
